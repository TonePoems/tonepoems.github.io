# Cool Projects

These are projects that I either found inspiration from, reference often, or just generally think are neat. 

This page is broken up into 

- [Technical Projects](#technical-projects)

## Technical Articles
I have several blogs and technical sites I like to read. Usually get a batch of them every month then try to get through one a day. Gives a break from technical stuff, easy reading during lunch, or expand my range a bit. Started this a few years ago when a former boss suggested daily reading as a habit for expanding/connecting ideas and staying current with interesting things.

- [Stack Overflow Blog](https://stackoverflow.blog/): Mainly focused on Webdev and AI right now. Some interesting things in their history.

- [Stack Exchange hot questions](https://stackexchange.com/questions?tab=hot): A lot more random things, find something interesting every now and again.

- [Stephen Wolfram Writings](https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/) Math and technical heavy. His personal and work writeups are nuts.

- [Hafbakery](https://www.halfbakery.com/): Just for fun/fuel to my never-ending list of side projects I'll totally get to one day...

- [Joel on Software](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/): Not many updates but older articles.

- [Atlassian Blog](https://www.atlassian.com/blog): Most recent addition. Pretty liberal/HR heavy approaches but food for thought. I really like their concept of playbooks that they share in some of them.

- [RJ Andrews](https://www.chartography.net/) is the data scientist who did the "Info We Trust" book and the moon landing website. I'm subscribed to his monthly(?) newsletter.


## Documentation and Visual Tools

Sourced from some work notes:

Someone asked today about Mermaid, and it made me want to share some of the other documentation and visual tools I've collected. Figured I should share the list with the whole operation. Please add to it if you have anything else!

- Obsidian: Great general purpose notetaking tool. Has good plugin support.

    - [Obsidian Kanban plugin](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-kanban): Creates a Kanban board for small tasks I can move as needed.

    - [Excalidraw plugin](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin): Integrates [Excalidraw]([https://excalidraw.com/](https://excalidraw.com/)), a feature rich sketching tool, into Obsidian.

    - [Obsidian Git plugin](https://github.com/denolehov/obsidian-git): Allows automatic backups of your obsidian vault.

    - [Dataview plugin](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview): Uses SQLite like commands to aggregate data from different files in the vault. I use it for totaling hours for my different projects to track percentages

    - Obsidian Checkboxes: I recently found a cool theme that extended markdown checkbobxes for different uses! So here it is in [snippit form](../resources/checkboxes.css), simply drop in your Obsidian Snippits folder and load into your application (May not work with all custom themes, but you can just modify the css).
        
        ```
- [ ] open  
- [x] complete  
- [!] important  
- [>] deferred  
- [?] question  
- [i] info  
- [-] canceled   
- [/] partial
        ```

- [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/): Deserves its own mention outside of the Obsidian plugin

- [Mermaid](https://mermaid.live/): Great for a range of diagrams, flow, sequence, class, and git! There is also Obsidian support for simple Mermaid style diagrams within code blocks

- [Ascii Flow](https://asciiflow.com/): Good tool for generating formatted text blocks with proper spacing for code comments

- [Fighter Brief](https://fighterbrief.com/): Huge shoutout to John DeWeese for introducing this to me. Cool way to display a range of military equipment and movement. NOT CUI SAFE, just fun to mess around with.

- [Symbl](https://symbl.cc/): for all your symbol needs
