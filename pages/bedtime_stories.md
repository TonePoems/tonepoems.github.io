# Bedtime Stories

These are born from my wife's request for rambling stories for her to fall asleep to, along with my lack of imagination and love of Calvin's dad's totally accurate histories.

- [John C. Paper](./Bedtime_Stories/paper.md), the inventor of paper.
- [Hermann T. Carr](./Bedtime_Stories/car.md), the inventor of the car.
- [Constantine Pine](./Bedtime_Stories/pine.md), the inventor of the Christmas tree. 
- [Iceiclus Creamicus](/Bedtime_Stories/ice_cream.md), the inventor of the ice cream.
