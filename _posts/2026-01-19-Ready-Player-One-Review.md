# Ready Player One Review

Craig really likes this one, and loaned me his copy. I got through it in several days.

Quick thoughts, writing ideas:
- VERY fast pace. No wasted space, the book really gets through the story
- Who was the story written to? Modern (to the story) audiences would be aware of the background and what was going on in the world.
- Liberal Themes
	- Megacorp
	- Global climate change
	- Slum "Stacks"
	- Black lesbian Aech
- Is it possible to watch, read and learn all the things it mentioned in the time stated? 
	- Multiple TVs and movies, all the games mentioned. Several tv shows were "rewatched" and all remembered perfectly.
	- Mentioned the number of years studying and that it was "easy to spend so much time when you have no life" but still seems crazy.
	- Something that could be calculated. Take the shows, movies mentioned and calculate runtimes.
- This man has never heard people interact. The interactions between Percival and Art3mis were cringe.
